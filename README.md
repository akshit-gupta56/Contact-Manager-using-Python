# Contact-Manager-using-Python
Tried to build a contact manager using python. The source code / main file is named as index.py and is located in the home directory. The executable file also know as .exe file is present in the dist folder and is named the same, index.
This project although completely runnig needs a few more changes and anyone coming up with the changes would get the credit. The discussion about the needed changes is carried out below. ALL THE PULL REQUESTS ARE WELCOMED. Any changes must be stored in a different branch named "suggested-changes".

First issue with the project is that the project uses tkinter module which contains a lot of different classes. I used a wildcard import which is not suggested in many cases and also not considered a good practise. If some can come up with the import of all the module that we have used in the project it will be very helpful and also well appreciated.

Another main concern regarding the project is, the final application window doesn't look that good. I welcome graphics designers, especially UI/UX designer to come up wit a more innovative and creative idea. AGAIN ALL SORT OF PULL REQUEST ARE WELCOMED. The changes made for the following must be stored in a different branch named "suggested-changes". You can upload the software core file such as the Xd-file or upload a jpg or any other exported format.

Any other changes and comments are also most welcomed.
